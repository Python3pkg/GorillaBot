{"name":"GorillaBot","tagline":"GorillaBot is an IRC bot written in Python.","body":"# GorillaBot\r\nGorillaBot is an IRC bot framework written in Python. The bot is initiated from the command line. Once it is connected, it receives its commands through IRC. Because I'm writing the framework mainly for use in a channel frequented by Wikipedia editors, there are a number of Wikipedia-specific commands.\r\n\r\n__Author:__ Molly White<br />\r\n__License:__ [MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)<br/>\r\n__Status:__ Unstable<br />\r\n__Version:__ 2.0\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n_Download code from the `master` branch. Code in the `rewrite` branch is often incomplete and non-functional._\r\n\r\n1. Run `python3 bot.py` from the source directory. This will step you through configuring the bot. If you already have already configured the bot, you can use that configuration or create a new one.\r\n2. Enter any information when prompted.\r\n3. Once the bot has successfully connected, command the bot from IRC. There are also a number of admin commands available to bot operators.\r\n\r\n# Commanding the bot\r\n\r\nThe bot receives commands in one of three ways:\r\n\r\n1. Detecting a word preceded by an exclamation point: `!command`<br/>\r\n2. Receiving a message addressed to it directly: `GorillaBot: command` or `GorillaBot: !command`<br/>\r\n3. Receiving a command in a private message: `/msg GorillaBot command`\r\n\r\nIn the examples below, I use the `!command` syntax, but the other two would work equally well.\r\n\r\n## All-user commands\r\nThese are the commands that are available to all users.\r\n\r\n### admincommands\r\n    !admincommands\r\n    !admincommandlist\r\n\r\n```irc\r\n< GorillaWarfare> !admincommands\r\n< GorillaBot> My available admin commands are join, part, quit, setcommand,\r\n              and unset.

You can get an API key by registering a project in the [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com/). Without a key, the normal linking will be used.\r\n    \r\n#### Settings\r\n* `auto` - All links entered in the chat will be parsed, regardless of whether they're prefaced with `!link`.\r\n\r\n### spotify\r\n    !spotify URI\r\n\r\n```irc\r\n< GorillaWarfare> !spotify spotify:track:6NmXV4o6bmp704aPGyTVVG\r\n< GorillaBot> \"BÃ¸n Fra Helvete (Live)\" by Kaizers Orchestra\r\n```\r\n\r\nProvide information about the Spotify URI.\r\n\r\n#### Settings\r\n* `auto` - All Spotify URIs in the chat will be parsed, regardless of whether they're prefaced with\r\n`!spotify`.\r\n\r\n### xkcd\r\n    !xkcd [number|query]\r\n    !relevantxkcd [number|query]\r\n\r\n```irc\r\n< GorillaWarfare> !xkcd batman acne\r\n< GorillaBot> xkcd: Complexion: http://xkcd.com/700/\r\n< GorillaWarfare> !xkcd 700\r\n< GorillaBot> xkcd: Complexion: http://xkcd.com/700/\r\n< GorillaWarfare> !xkcd\r\n< GorillaBot> xkcd: Telescope Names: http://xkcd.com/1294/\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout any arguments, this provides a random xkcd comic. When a number is supplied, it tries to return the xkcd comic with that given number. When a query string is supplied, it tries to return the xkcd comic that most closely matches that query.\r\n\r\n## Admin-only commands\r\nThese commands are only available to bot operators.\r\n\r\n### join\r\n    !join #channel\r\nJoins the specified channel. Only joins one channel at a time.\r\n\r\n### part\r\n    !part [#channel] [message]\r\nParts from the specified channel, or the current channel if unspecified. Only parts from one channel at a time. If a message is included, this will be used as the part message.\r\n\r\n### quit\r\n    !quit [message]\r\n    !shutdown [message]\r\nQuits the bot from the network and shuts down.\r\n\r\n### set\r\n    !set setting value [#channel]\r\n\r\n```irc\r\n< GorillaWarfare> !set link auto\r\n< GorillaBot> \"link\" set to \"auto\" in ##GorillaBot.\r\n```\r\n\r\nChange settings for a command. Allowed and default settings for a command are viewable in the command's documentation. Settings can only be edited for channels the bot is joined to, or has been joined to in the past.\r\n\r\n### unset\r\n    !unset setting [#channel]\r\n\r\n```irc\r\n< GorillaWarfare> !unset link\r\n< GorillaBot> \"link\" unset for ##GorillaBot.\r\n```\r\n\r\nRemoves the setting for a channel. This will revert to the default value. Settings can only be edited for channels the bot is joined to, or has been joined to in the past.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
