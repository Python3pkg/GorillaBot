If you were words on a page, you'd be what they call fine print.
If you were a booger, I'd pick you.
What's your sign?
I wanna live in your socks so I can be with you every step of the way.
Let's make like a fabric softener and Snuggle.
I'm a fermata... hold me.
Do you have a quarter? My mom told me to call her when I fell in love.
If you were a booger I'd rearrange the alphabet so you fell from heaven!
